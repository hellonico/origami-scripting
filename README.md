# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

This module is deprecated and no longer maintained.

All scripts have been migrated to the [clojure-cli-samples](https://github.com/hellonico/origami-clojure-cli-samples) module, which uses the modern `clj` CLI tool instead of `inlein`.

Please use `clojure-cli-samples` instead.

_Original instructions (historical reference only):_

This used [inlein](https://github.com/hypirion/inlein) to run scripts with inline dependencies.

```bash
wget -o inlein https://github.com/hypirion/inlein/releases/download/0.2.0/inlein
chmod +x inlein
mv inlein /usr/local/bin
```
